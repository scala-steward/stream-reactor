 * The `HttpWriter` owns a single topic's ingest-to-send pipeline.

 * Records enter via [[add]] (called on the Kafka Connect `put` thread), which hands whole chunks of
 * records to a concurrent [[cats.effect.std.Queue]]. Backpressure is enforced by a
 * [[cats.effect.std.Semaphore]] whose permits count individual records (capped at `maxQueueSize`):
 * a producer acquires one permit per record before enqueuing, blocking until capacity frees up or
 * `maxQueueOfferTimeout` elapses, at which point a `RetriableException` is raised (so Kafka
 * Connect's retry configuration takes over). Passing records as chunks keeps the number of queue
 * operations and fiber hand-offs proportional to the number of `put` calls, not the number of
 * records.
 *
 * Permit acquisition and the queue offer are atomic with respect to cancellation: once permits are
 * acquired they are always paired with an enqueued chunk (and, symmetrically, a chunk's permits are
 * always released once the batch has been sent), so a cancellation can never strand permits with no
 * chunk for the consumer to release them against.
 *
 * A single long-lived consumer fiber (started by `HttpWriterManager`) drives [[consume]], which
 * takes a chunk, feeds the records into a mutable [[BatchAccumulator]] and flushes a batch whenever
 * the configured [[BatchPolicy]] triggers (by count, size, or a time-based interval deadline). A
 * record's permit is held for its whole lifetime in the writer -- it is released only when the
 * record leaves the pipeline (flushed on a successful send, or dropped on a below-threshold
 * failure), so the semaphore bounds queue + accumulator + in-flight records together rather than
 * just the queue. Because a permit is held while a record sits in the accumulator, the batch record
 * count trigger must not exceed `maxQueueSize` (enforced by config validation) or a batch could
 * never fill while producers are blocked on permits.
 *
 * Production code should prefer [[HttpWriter.create]]. Direct construction is retained for tests
 * and benchmarks that need to inject or observe the writer's internal state.
