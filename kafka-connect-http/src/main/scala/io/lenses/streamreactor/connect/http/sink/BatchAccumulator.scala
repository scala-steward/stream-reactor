/**
 * Incremental, single-consumer batch builder for the HTTP sink.
 *
 * Records are pushed one at a time via [[offer]] and the configured [[BatchPolicy]] is evaluated
 * against a running commit context. This is the streaming equivalent of
 * `io.lenses.streamreactor.common.batch.RecordsQueueBatcher.takeBatch`: the per-record policy
 * evaluation is identical, but it is driven by a push of individual records.
 *
 * This type is deliberately '''mutable and not thread-safe''': it is owned by a single consumer
 * fiber (one per topic), so no synchronisation is required. Mutability keeps the hot path
 * allocation-free -- records accumulate in a reusable buffer and the policy is evaluated against a
 * single reused [[CommitContext]] whose `count`/`fileSize` are updated in place. The policy
 * conditions read only `count`/`fileSize`/`lastModified` (never `committedOffsets`), so the
 * per-partition max offsets are merged once, at flush time, rather than on every record.
 *
 * The full configurable policy surface is preserved: `Count`, `FileSize` and `Interval` (including
 * the greedy-interval semantics). The interval is measured from the last flush
 * (`HttpCommitContext.lastFlushedTimestamp`, falling back to `createdTimestamp`).
