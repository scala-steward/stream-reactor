/**
 * Integration tests for AWS SigV4 signing using WireMock as the target.
 *
 * WireMock stubs verify that:
 * (a) The signed POST /_bulk request reaches WireMock with an Authorization header (B2).
 * (b) The signed GET / info probe also carries Authorization (B2).
 * (c) 302 redirect from WireMock is NOT followed (credential replay prevention) (C2).
 *
 * C5 - LocalStack compromise note:
 * A full LocalStack-backed `OpenSearchSigV4LocalStackIT` would provide stronger guarantees
 * (real SigV4 endpoint verification, actual credential chain resolution), but it requires:
 *  - A LocalStack Docker image in testcontainers (>2 GB)
 *  - OpenSearch Serverless endpoint configuration on LocalStack
 *  - Additional `software.amazon.awssdk:opensearchserverless` dependencies
 *
 * The WireMock-only IT is the accepted compromise for this project: it verifies that the
 * `Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 ...` header is present and well-formed on BOTH the info probe
 * and the bulk request, which covers the connector's signing behaviour without requiring a real
 * AWS endpoint. The risk accepted by this compromise is that the SigV4 signature ALGORITHM is
 * not verified end-to-end against a real AWS endpoint; the AWS SDK's own unit tests cover that.
