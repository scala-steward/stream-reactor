/**
 * LC-318: shared contract asserting that every `StorageInterface` backend excludes directory
 * markers (keys ending in "/", e.g. console-created "folders") and zero-byte placeholder
 * objects from `list`, `listKeysRecursive` and `listFileMetaRecursive`, mirroring
 * `AwsS3StorageInterface`'s original filtering.
 *
 * `kafka-connect-aws-s3` and `kafka-connect-gcp-storage` both depend on `cloud-common` via
 * `test->test` in build.sbt, which makes this trait visible to both modules' test sources.
 * Each backend's test suite mixes this trait in and implements the fixture hooks below using
 * whichever client-mocking approach suits that backend; a divergence in either backend's
 * filtering will fail here.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered here: pagination/resume-marker semantics for a page that is
 * *entirely* filtered out. S3 and GCS diverge there by design (S3's marker is derived from the
 * filtered sequence and yields no marker for an all-filtered page; GCS keeps the raw last
 * object as its marker so offset-based pagination still advances). That divergence is exercised
 * by backend-specific regression tests, not this shared contract.
 *
 * Also not covered: unknown/null object size. GCS fails open (keeps the object when
 * Blob.getSize is null) so a listing that omits size cannot silently starve the source; S3's
 * `_.size() > 0` throws on a null Long and surfaces a FileListError. Aligning S3 would be a
 * behaviour change and is out of scope for LC-318.
