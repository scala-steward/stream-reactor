/**
 * How a PARTITIONBY sink commits the writers it holds for one Kafka topic-partition.
 *
 *  - [[CommitMode.Granular]] (default, the pre-existing behaviour): each writer commits
 *    independently against its own granular lock, keyed by the partition key. Exactly-once
 *    therefore depends on the PARTITIONBY key being a deterministic function of the record:
 *    a replayed offset must route back to the key whose lock recorded it.
 *  - [[CommitMode.Batch]]: every open writer on the topic-partition is committed together
 *    through a single master-lock compare-and-swap, and deduplication uses a
 *    topic-partition-level floor. Exactly-once no longer depends on key determinism.
 *
 * Switching between modes requires the connector to be stopped first; see
 * `docs/datalake-exactly-once-partitionby.md`.
